## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Copy the `.env.example` variables into a separate `.env.local` file
3. Create the required credentials:
   - Clerk authentication keys
   - PostgreSQL database connection string
   - Gemini API key

## 🔨 How to Fork and Clone

1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this repository to create your own copy
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Install dependencies with `bun install`
4. Set up your environment variables in `.env.local`
5. Run database migrations with `bun db:push`
6. Seed the database with `bun db:seed`
7. Run the development server with `bun dev`

## 📦 Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/meetsy

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# For AI Features
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_MODEL=gemini-flash-latest
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=
```

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted like NeonDB)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed

### Setup Steps

1. Push the database schema:

```bash
bun db:push
```

2. (Optional but Recommended) Seed the database with test data:

```bash
bun db:seed
```

This creates:

- **5 FREE users** (demonstrating tier limits: 1 community, 1 goal each)
- **12 PRO users** (including test accounts with unlimited access)
- **6 diverse communities**:
  - Modern Full Stack Next.js Course
  - Developer to Leader
  - Ankita's Youtube Community
  - Python for Data Science
  - AI & Machine Learning
  - Cloud & DevOps
- **Learning goals** for each community
- **Sample matches** between users (both accepted and pending)
- **Conversations** with messages
- **AI-generated conversation summaries**

3. Open Drizzle Studio to explore your database:

```bash
bun db:studio
```

## 💻 Development Commands

```bash
# Application
bun dev          # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
bun build        # Build for production
bun start        # Start production server
bun lint         # Run ESLint

# Database Management
bun db:generate  # Generate migrations from schema changes
bun db:push      # Push schema directly to database
bun db:studio    # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
bun db:seed      # Seed database with test data
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Server-first with Next.js App Router, client components only where needed
2. **API Layer**: Hono framework ([app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts](app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts)) for lightweight, fast API
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM ([db/schema.ts](db/schema.ts)) for type-safe queries
4. **Authentication**: Clerk handles all auth, session management, and user synchronization
5. **AI Services**: Vercel AI SDK with Google gemini-flash-latest for matching and summaries
6. **State Management**: React Query for server state, React hooks for local state

### API Routes Structure

- `/api/communities/*` - Community management and discovery
- `/api/matches/*` - AI-powered and manual matching system
- `/api/conversations/*` - Chat, messaging, and AI summaries
- `/api/user/*` - User profile and subscription management

All routes use Clerk authentication middleware and Hono error handling.

## 🤖 AI Features

### Semantic Matching

The AI matching system uses gemini-flash-latest to analyze learning goals and find compatible partners:

- Understands goals beyond keyword matching (e.g., "React basics" matches with "React Hooks deep dive")
- Evaluates topic similarity, complementary skills, and learning styles
- Creates up to 3 curated matches per request
- Filters out existing matches to prevent duplicates

### Conversation Summaries

AI-generated insights from chat conversations include:

- **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of the discussion
- **Key Points**: Important topics and insights shared
- **Action Items**: Concrete tasks to follow up on
- **Next Steps**: Recommendations for future learning

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues

- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1"`
- Check DATABASE_URL format: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
- Verify user permissions for database operations

### Clerk Authentication Issues

- Verify all Clerk environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure your Clerk account is properly configured
- User sync happens automatically through Clerk middleware

### AI Features Not Working

- Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is valid and has credits
- Check API rate limits if getting 429 errors
- Review console logs for detailed error messages

### Build/Runtime Errors

- Clear `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
- Ensure you have Bun installed (this project uses Bun as the runtime)
- Check environment variables are properly set in `.env.local`
